# Learning python to expand my profile

This repository documents my learning of Python as a supporting tool for engineering and problem-solving.

I am using structured tutorials ( Corey Schafer's Youtube playlist ) to build a strong foundation, with a focus on understanding concepts and applying them to practical problems.

## Structure
- Each folder corresponds to one tutorial topic
- Code files contain practice examples
- Notes files include reflections and questions

## Purpose
To document my progress and improve on them, also to use them in future projects.
