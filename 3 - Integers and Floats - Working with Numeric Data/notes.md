# General, Arithmetic Operators, and Comparisons

## Overview
Notes covering basic numeric operations in Python, including arithmetic operators, comparisons, and commonly used built-in functions.

## Key Concepts
- Odd and even numbers can be identified using `% 2`
- `abs()` returns the absolute value of a number
- Casting can be done using `int()`
- Arithmetic operators perform mathematical calculations
- Comparison operators compare values and return booleans

## Important Details
> `%` returns the remainder of a division 
> `abs()` always returns a non-negative number.  
> `/` always returns a float
> `//` performs floor division and rounds down
> Comparison operations return `True` or `False`.

## Examples
- Odd / Even check:
  ```python
  num = 5
  num % 2 == 1
